This set of lecture notes has been developed for short hands-on training courses on information extraction from foreign exchange (FX) options, namely reverse engineering option price quotes to obtain the market views on the probability distribution of the exchange rate. 

The main target audience are economists and analysts with a working understanding of econometric and quantitative methods as well as some basic familiarity with option pricing. Attending to the needs of this audience, the notes keep the mathematics and theory light and emphasize understanding the intuition behind pricing conventions, option valuation theory, and the numerical methods.

By design, the topics are presented in a light-hearted manner from the perspective of an anti-heroine, B.A. Payne. Humor is a useful learning technique, something I learned from the late Salih Neftci during the numerous courses he delivered at the International Monetary Fund in the mid-2000s. A cheerful and playful state of mind certainly works wonders for absorbing the myriad of concepts these notes present in a rather compressed way. Some attentive readers may note that the main title for these series of notes, _Adventures in Macrofinancial Analysis_, is a shameless steal of the title of Sidney Resnick's awesome book on stochastic processes [@Resnick1992].

Reverse engineering security prices is mainly a numerical computation task. All calculations are performed using `R` [@R-base], executed within the `RStudio` IDE [@R-RStudio]. I chose the `R` software environment because it incorporates state-of-the-art methods rapidly. Equally important, the environment allows integrating calculations and reporting which helped turning these notes into an easy-to-update dynamic document following the best practices of reproducible research (-@xie2015 and -@Gandrud2015).

Rather than implementing the extraction methods from scratch, the calculations take advantage of the  `RND` package [@R-RND] available in the [CRAN repository](https://cran.r-project.org/). The `RND` package implements methods useful for a wide variety of options, not only FX. Armed with an understanding of the package and the concepts in these pages, the reader may want to explore later options markets other than the FX market.^[Readers interested in extraction methods specialized for FX options and associated `Matlab` codes could look at @Blake-Rule2015.]

Feedback from readers helps to improve these lecture notes and keep them current. Please direct send comments and suggestions, which are always welcome, to jchanlauimf@gmail.com, with subject topic _Lecture notes on FX options_.
